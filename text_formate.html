            He <strong>Tiger</strong>  (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland <b>Asian tigers</b> and the island tigers of the Sunda <mark>Islands</mark>. Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the <u>Russian</u> Far East and <em>Northeast China</em> to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. <b>Tigers</b> are also victims of human wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is legally protected in all range countries. <i>National</i> conservation measures consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and tiger reintroduction is planned.</p>
